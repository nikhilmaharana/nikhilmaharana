Hi! I’m Nikhil — an MCA student, Full-Stack Developer, and an explorer of AI/ML and digital creativity.

💻 On the tech side:
I build intuitive web apps using Django and Python, and enjoy experimenting with AI's and data-driven projects. I love turning real-world ideas into fully functional platforms.

🎧 On the creative side:
I’m a singer and guitar cover artist with an engaged music audience on Instagram (@nikhil.maharana.music). Music keeps me expressive, creative, and balanced — even in tech chaos.

🚀 Currently:
• Interned at Web Bocket (Full Stack + Data Science role) 
• Expanding my skills in Data Analytics and ML 

📬 Looking to connect with forward-thinkers in tech or music. Let’s collaborate, build, or jam — digitally or creatively!
